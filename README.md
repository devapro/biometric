# Biometric-Auth
Add Biometric Authentication to any Android app</br>

This library based on https://github.com/anitaa1990/Biometric-Auth-Sample. It is kotlin version with some improvements.


This library provides an easy way to implement fingerprint authentication without having to deal with all the boilerplate stuff going on inside.

<h2>How to integrate the library in your app?</h2>
<b>Gradle Dependecy</b></br>

```gradle
dependencies {
        implementation 'pro.devapp.biometric:biometric:1.0.0'
}
```

<h2>Usage</h2>

```
val dialogV23: BiometricDialogV23Interface = ....
        BiometricManager(
            this@MainActivity,
            "Title",
            "Subtitle example",
            "Description example",
            "Cancel",
            "Error text",
            dialogV23
        ).authenticate(biometricCallback)
```
The ```BiometricDialogV23Interface``` interface for dialog to support devices before BiometricPrompt. You can found implementation in example app

The ```BiometricCallback``` class has the following callback methods:

```
BiometricCallback {
              override fun onSdkVersionNotSupported() {
                     /*  
                      *  Will be called if the device sdk version does not support Biometric authentication
                      */
               }

               override fun onBiometricAuthenticationNotSupported() {
                     /*  
                      *  Will be called if the device does not contain any fingerprint sensors 
                      */
               }

               override fun  onBiometricAuthenticationNotAvailable() {

                      */

                        */
